#Rust Path Tracer
This project is based on a tutorial called [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html).
I decided to port the code to Rust since I wanted to learn the language and do it through a fun project. The code isn't perfect yet, but
I am hoping to iterate over it from time-to-time and build out some more features and fix bugs.
